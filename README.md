The Jupyter notebook `AMNSSS_kommentiert.ipynb` contains a computation, which aims to disprove Proposition 2.4 in _<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00454-023-00538-5">Recovery of Plane Curves from Branch Points</a>_ by D. Agostini, H. Markwig, C. Nollau, V. Schleis, J. Sendra-Arranz and B. Sturmfels. The computation shows that the base locus of the discriminant map on the space of ternary quadric forms has at least three irreducible components, while the proposition claims there to be two. 

The notebook was prepared by Tim Burdack and Igor Makhlin as part of Tim Burdack's bachelor's thesis and uses the <a href="https://www.oscar-system.org">OSCAR</a> computer algebra system.
